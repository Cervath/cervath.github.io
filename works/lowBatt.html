                        <p align = "justify">
                          My first task was to start implementing the various player weapons (now there are fewer), but as the project
                           progressed, I worked on other necessary systems, such as interactables (hittable and activatable objects). 
                           Like all my colleagues, I also helped fix bugs that arose elsewhere during development, and helped finalize the
                            menus towards the end of development.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Things learned</h3>
                        <p align = "justify">
                          In this game, I have been able to get as close as possible to the video game industry, working collaboratively with designers, artists, and 
                          producers, discussing and helping to implement their ideas. Although I had previously worked with other programmers, I had never been part of a 
                          team of this size, where I had to deal with different programmers working on parts of my code and vice versa. Along the way, I have learned to work 
                          better with Unreal, understand its features, and how to address them.
                         </p>
                        
                       
                        <h3>Player's Weapons</h3>
                        <p align = "justify">
                            The player's gun was intended to have different types of bullets that would change with certain modifications, but in the end,
                            these were discarded and others were added instead. However, the structure remains the same, allowing new functionalities to be added 
                            easily. To manage its different bullets, UActorComponents have been created for each characteristic, ensuring that they are portable
                            to other actors.

                          Since it's just a single gun, it manages a pool of bullets that are generated at the start, and all possible systems they might have,
                          such as collisions, mesh, ticks, etc., are deactivated. When the player triggers the gun to fire a bullet, it simply follows an iterator 
                          that calls the bullet's activation method, activating everything necessary and putting it in motion. Once the bullet collides with something 
                          or after a certain number of seconds, it returns to the pool, deactivating completely.

                                <li>A large one for enemies and activatables.</li>
                                <li>A small one for environmental elements.</li>

                             This ensures that the player has a wide margin to hit their targets but doesn't easily collide with environmental elements.

                    <h4> Explosive Things</h4>
                    <p align = "justify">
                        Having two elements that caused radial damage, I decided to create a UActorComponent that would be URadialDamage. This component would handle
                         everything related to the damage to be applied to an area, and you would only need to pass the area of effect to it. Additionally, it would 
                         also take care of the particles and the detection of other explosive elements to make them explode.I tried to use the radial damage feature 
                         in Unreal from the FDamage class, but since it wasn't working as expected, I created a custom class to implement that damage.
                         

                        <br><br>
                       When an element explodes, it will overlap with all the elements that have the explosive tag, and then categorize them by their collision channel.
                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; text-align: justify;">
                                <li>Enemies that will receive damage.</li>
                                <li>Elements that will explode.</li>
                        </ul>

                        For enemies, it will simply apply the corresponding damage. However, with other explosive elements, it will store them one by one in an array.

                        only mines, and they will repeat the same procedure until none are left.

                      I had to create both the expanding circle and the blinking material myself. For the blinking light, it involved creating a material with a 
                      parameterizable timer. For the expanding circles, a Torus from Unreal was created, and all parts were removed to leave only the outer circle. 
                      For the inner area, a simple Unreal disk was created.

                    <p align = "justify">
                      The atomic explosion shares many similarities with a mine, but it differs in its activation method and response.

                    <p align = "justify">
                      When the player kills an enemy, it drops an yellow energy orb that moves toward the player. Once the ability bar is filled, the player can use the atomic 
                      explosion, but when you use it there will be a cooldown before you can gain more energy. 
                    </p>
                      <p align = "justify">
                      The player needs to hold down the ability button and surpass a yellow circle to detonate it. The explosion will continue to expand until
                       it reaches a red circle, which is the maximum range. Once the player releases the button, the explosion occurs. However, if the yellow circle is 
                       not surpassed, the explosion will be canceled.
                      </p>
                      <p align = "justify">
                        The area of effect for this weapon is always visible. While with the mine we only see the activation radius, the nuclear explosion shows the 
                        effect radius, which increases as the circle expands. If the mine explosion encounters obstacles like walls or boxes, it won't affect objects 
                        behind them. However, the nuclear explosion can pass through elements marked as "cover".

                      <p align = "justify">
                        I needed to create an actor that could move around the scene but could take many forms, so I created the Movable Platform class to unify all its 
                        forms into a generic one, as the functionality would be the same: moving from point A to point B.
                      </p>
                      <p align = "justify">
                          The actor has a TArray with all the possible locations it needs to go to, although in Low Batt, only two are used. When activated, a movement 
                          is generated between its current point and the next point in the list. When there are no more points in the list, it loops back to the 
                          beginning. To add these points, I use empty actors that can be generated through an editor tool I created.
                      </p>

                                 The movement is made possible by a library from <a href="https://github.com/jdcook/fresh_cooked_tweens" target="_blank">Tween</a>. 
                                 Using a reference graph, we can choose how we want the movement to be executed, adding specific animations to the different platforms.
                               <br><br>
                               The mathematical formula is also provided, allowing us to understand how it works and replicate it outside the library.
                               <br><br>
                               To add a bit more feedback, when the platform reaches its destination, sparks are emitted, simulating a collision.

                        As I didn't know what type of entities the movable platforms would be at the time, and since it was a generic form, they weren't designed to be
                         attached to another element. Even so, I tried to put the platform within the door frame class, but some things didn't work out, so I decided to 
                         keep it separate.

                      <p align = "justify">
                        At certain times, we will need to activate more than one button to open a door. For this, we will have a traffic light as visual support, 
                        indicating how many remaining buttons need to be activated.

                              is designed to have as many lights as you want, and the lights will turn on in order as you activate them. Once you activate the last light,
                               you will activate the desired platform.

                        At the beginning, it was just a fall checkpoint, but once that was implemented, we realized we didn't have death checkpoints. So, when I moved 
                        on to another task, a teammate took the base I created and added everything related to the player's death.

                             The checkpoints consist of two BP triggers: one to delimit the fall zone and another to obtain the next checkpoint.
                            <br><br>
                            
                            The fall BP only needs to be linked to the empty actors that will serve as the locations of the checkpoints. The checkpoint BP only needs 
                            the fall BP to link to it, so each time you pass through one, it increments the current checkpoint iterator by one.
                            <br><br>
                            In the event you fall through a gap, you'll be teleported to the current checkpoint, and in my teammates' update with death, the level's 
                            state will revert to the state before the conflict zone.

                      <p align = "justify">
                        Until nearly the end of development, there were no transitions between levels; you couldn't organically move from one to the other. So, taking 
                        advantage of the fade in/out effect a teammate created for entering the game, I was asked to make those transitions.

                            The class will just be a trigger volume to detect the player. When detected, it will start the fade in, and upon completion, teleport the 
                            player to the next zone, initiating the fade out while simultaneously activating the pertinent platform (usually an elevator).
                            <br><br>
                            For map changes, a boolean will need to be activated to indicate this. The only procedural change will be that at the end of the fade in, it 
                            will switch maps, calling the transition scene.

                      Now, there are different things I would change or rather improve from the start. The system for connecting points with movable platforms was not 
                      very designer-friendly, and although I created a tool to improve this task towards the end of development, it was too late to be useful.

                    <p align = "justify">
                      From the beginning, I tried to structure the code and variables well so that it would be more readable. In a way, it is like that, but I would 
                      have liked to have worked more on this aspect to follow best practices more closely.
